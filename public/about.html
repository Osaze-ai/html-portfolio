<h1>ABOUT</h1>

<h3>I'm Osaze. A designer, maker and problem solver, crafting beautiful web experiences </h3>

<p>I was that kid who would take apart anything to see how it worked, and then try to put it back together to make it even better. As you can imagine this made my parents think twice about buying me new toys and gadgets. This tinkering trait has served me well in my career as a junior web developer with 1+ years experience, I've been experimenting with website layouts since the days of My Space.</p>

<p>Fast Forward to 2023 and I've worked on Digital Campaign Designs to Web Design, Animation, HTML/CSS, Vanilla JavaSctipt and Project Management. Everything I have done, small or big, has been a vital stepping stone for where I am today.
